#FluentHtml for PHP

Stupid simple way to read and write html using pure php.

- much cleaner than `<?php echo $value ?>`
- lighter than a template language
- simple to extend (using traits)
- ideally suited for rapid prototyping and ad hoc scripts
- stupid simple: no unncesscary abstractions, just a clean intutive api

More documentation on it's way.
